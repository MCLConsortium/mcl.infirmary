## 📜 Changelog

Here we track the changes from release to release.


### 0.0.2

-   [Issue 1](https://github.com/MCLConsortium/mcl.infirmary/issues/1)
    -   Adds version (and [Sickbay](https://pypi.org/project/mcl.sickbay/) version) to the `/ping` endpoint
    -   Add `--version` command-line option
    -   Announces the version to the `info` log at start-up


### 0.0.1

In this release, we added the changelog! 🤯

We also pin to version `mcl.sickbay-0.0.5`. For some reason, we can't do a `python3 setup.py install` without it pinned inside the Docker image creation 🤷‍♀️
